# Curl_Yahtzee
 Yahtzee game

This is a way to play yahtzee via java
(this does not include joker rules)

This has three classes: Dice, Player, and Curl_Yahtzee_Game(Main)

The game intakes 1-6 players and asks for a name for each player
Then it starts the game with each player having an order roll for positioning
Then the game will roll the dice for the first person asking if they want to keep some/all the dice
roll the dice again
and/or insert the dice into a category

It does this for 13/15 rounds of the game adding the scores at the end to see who won

Hope you enjoy!
